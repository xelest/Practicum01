If an error occurs with the code:
-My.Resources.Click_to_browse
-My.Resources.Connected
-My.Resources.Disconnect
So to overcome this, put all the images in the folder with the name "File if there is a MyResources error" in this folder to the folder with the name of the folder "Resources" in your project folder.
Then run the application, if there is still an error involving the three codes above, close your Visual Studio and then run the application again.
